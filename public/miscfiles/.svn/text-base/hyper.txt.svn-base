Configuring Hyperterminal for the R31JP

The lab computers should all have a 9600 baud R31JP shortcut on the
desktop that loads Hyperterminal with the correct settings.  If you
would like to set up Hyperterminal or another program on your own
computer, configure the COM port as follows:

   Baud Rate: 9600
   Data Bits: 8
      Parity: None
   Stop Bits: 1
Flow Control: None
