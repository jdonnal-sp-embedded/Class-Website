<H2><A NAME="Overview"></A>Overview</H2>
<p>The Amulet method of displaying graphics on an LCD is totally different 
from traditional methods. The Amulet Browser Chip handles all the LCD and 
touchpanel functions so your micro doesn't have to. Hardware wise, the only 
requirement is that your micro&nbsp;needs  a UART in order to use the Amulet system. On the software 
side, you need to create an Amulet serial protocol handler. Generally, the only 
thing that is being sent via the serial link is data.</p>
<p>Here's the Amulet system in a nutshell.<br>1. HTML authoring tools 
are used to create a Graphical User Interface(GUI).<br>2. The Amulet HTMLCompiler is 
used
to compile your GUI to a small binary file which is then downloaded into the 
Amulet module.<br>3. The Amulet module displays the GUI and&nbsp;handles 
all touchpanel interaction.<br>4. The Amulet module receives 
input data from your host microprocessor via the serial link  and also sends command messages to 
your micro based upon timer-based or touchpanel events.</p>
<p>There are two types of variables in the Amulet system. External variables 
(byte, word and string) which reside on your micro's side and <a href="internalRAM.htm">InternalRAM 
variables</a> (byte, word and string) which reside on the Amulet module. InternalRAM&nbsp;is 
quasi-dual port RAM that can be read from and written to by the Amulet chip 
through commands inserted in the HTML code. Your micro interfaces&nbsp;to InternalRAM 
through the serial link. There are specific UART commands that can read from 
and write to InternalRAM.</p>
<p>There are four major types of serial messages that will be sent between the 
Amulet module and your micro.<br>1. A request of a variable (byte, word or 
string)<br>2. A setting of a variable (byte, word or string)<br>3. A Remote 
Procedure Call, which is a completely generic message which allows the Amulet module to inform your micro of a certain event. You can have up to 256 unique 
RPC's. What those RPC's signify is entirely up to you.<br>4. A raw byte, or 
group of bytes,&nbsp;can be sent from the Amulet module to your micro. This 
option is not part of the Amulet serial protocol, but rather it gives you the 
flexibility to have the Amulet  module send you small commands that do not 
need to be answered.<br>Please see the <a href="Protocol.htm">UART Protocol 
document</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Your LCD's user interface is created using standard HTML authoring tools, 
such as Front Page, Dreamweaver, Namo etc... To complement the standard HTML, 
Amulet has created a number of I/O objects, referred to&nbsp;as <a href="Widgets.htm">Amulet 
Widgets</a> which can be inserted into the HTML source code via the APPLET tag. 
There are two types of Amulet Widgets, Control Widgets and View Widgets. Control 
Widgets are input objects, like function buttons, sliders, radio buttons, etc... 
Control Widgets have a <a href="functions.htm">function</a>, or a set of functions, 
that can be applied to them. For instance, a function button can be set to send 
a Remote Procedure Call #5 out the UART every time it is pressed. View Widgets 
are output objects, like bargraphs, numeric fields, string fields, etc... View 
Widgets call a function which returns the data used as the input for that particular 
widget. For instance, a bargraph can have a function which requests external 
byte variable #3 every 100ms over the UART.</p>
<p>The complexity of the serial protocol handler depends upon the type of communication 
you will be using in your system. You can set up your project so that the Amulet module is the master, requesting data at given update rates and sending 
command messages asynchronously. Or your micro can be the master, sending data 
to the Amulet module unsolicited. And you can also use a dual master setup, 
where the Amulet module is sending asynchronous command messages to your micro, 
yet your micro is also sending unsolicited data to the Amulet.</p>

		<h2><a name="Install"></a>Using HTML Compiler Help</h2>
		<P>HTMLCompiler help is actually a website made up of HTML pages. The home page is named readme.htm and is installed
on your hardrive in the HTMLCompiler's main directory -- typically C:\Program Files\Amulet\readme.htm. HTMLCompiler
help can be &quot;browsed&quot; from most recent browsers, however, frames capability is recommended for best results.</P>
		<P>When you invoke help from within HTMLCompiler, help\help.htm is invoked by passing it to the Windows API ShellExecute.
This will perform the equivalent of double-clicking on the HTML file in Windows Explorer. In most cases, this will
invoke your preferred browser.</P>
<P><B>NOTE</B>: If you have the file association for .HTM files set to open an HTML editor, or some other program,
that program will be opened, instead of your browser, when you invoke help from within HTMLCompiler.<BR>
