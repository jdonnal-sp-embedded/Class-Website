		<H2><a name="FirstGUI">Creating Your First Amulet Graphical User Interface</a></H2>
<P>By now, you should be familiar with the operation and navigation of the Amulet module. The next step is to
use the Amulet HTMLCompiler to compile and program a GUI. In keeping with a long-standing programming tradition,
this section introduces you to the Amulet development tools by guiding you through the creation of a &quot;Hello,
World!&quot; program -- Amulet Style. Proceed as follows:</P>
<P>Launch the HTMLCompiler by whichever means you prefer.</P>

<OL>
	<LI>From the HTMLCompiler's <B>File</B> menu, select <B>Open</B>. You will be presented with a file dialog box.
	
  <LI>Use the controls in the file dialog to locate the file home.htm from the 
    <A HREF="../projects/tour/" target="_blank">\projects\tour\</A> subdirectory 
    of the Amulet main directory. By default the Amulet main directory is C:\Program 
    Files\Amulet, however you may have specified a different path during the install. 
  <LI>Select home.htm and click the <B>Open</B> button.
</OL>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Images/openHome.gif" WIDTH="428" HEIGHT="266" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
<P>The HTMLCompiler will open and compile home.htm and all other files that are linked from home.htm. When the
conversion is complete the compiler will display:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>&lt;Successful Compile!  Ready to Program 17 files (12032 bytes) into Flash&gt;</B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Images/compiledHome.gif" WIDTH="608" HEIGHT="386" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
		<P><B>NOTE:</B> DO NOT click on the <B>Program Flash</B> button yet because you must first prepare the Amulet module for programming.</P>
		<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
		<H2>Setting up the RS232 port for Flash programming</H2>
<P>Before you can program your &quot;Hello, World&quot; program into the Amulet Flash, you must first select
a comm port and a programming baud rate.<BR>
<BR>
To select a serial port for programming:

<OL>
	<LI>From the HTMLCompiler's <B>Settings </B>menu, select <B>RS232</B>. You will be presented with an RS232 dialog
	box similar to the one pictured below.<BR>
	<IMG SRC="Images/baud1.gif" WIDTH="232" HEIGHT="190" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">
	<LI>Next, select any available serial port from the <B>Comm Port</B> list. All ports listed in your Windows Registry will be listed.	<LI>Then, choose a baud from the <B>Bit Rate</B> list. The bit rate must match the bit rate selected by Switch
	2 of the Amulet module's DIP switch. If you selected 115200, be sure to place Switch 2 in the OFF position. If
	you selected 19200, be sure to place Switch 2 in the ON position.
	<LI>Finally click the <B>OK</B> button.
</OL>

<P>Now, you must connect the Amulet module to the PC. Before proceeding, remove the power from your Amulet module and make sure the module DIP switch settings on SW2 are as follows:<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<TABLE BORDER="0">
		<TR>
			<TD><IMG SRC="Images/dipFlash.gif" WIDTH="64" HEIGHT="79" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></TD>
			<TD  NOWRAP>Switch 1 (Boot Mode) = ON (normal) (<a href="#* Note">*See 
                note below</a>)<br>
				Switch 2 (Program Baud Rate) = OFF (115200) or ON (19200) <B><BR>
				NOTE:</B> This must match the  <A HREF="compiler.htm#SerialSetup">bit rate set for the compiler</A>.<BR>
				Switch 3 (RAM Test) = OFF (disabled)<BR>
				Switch 4 (Touch Panel Mode) = ON (Normal operation)</TD>
		</TR>
	</TABLE>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>Connect one end of the 9-pin serial cable (included with the starter kit) to the serial port (J2) on the Amulet module and the other end to the assigned serial port on your computer. Now go ahead and apply power to the Amulet module.</P>
<p><a name="* Note">* Note</a>: Upon clicking on the <B>Program Flash</B> button in the Compiler window, the Compiler will attempt to send out an auto &quot;wake-up&quot; message to the Amulet controller. If the page currently being displayed is set up to use the same baud rate using the <a href="HTMLSupport.htm#META">META</a> tag (if META is not present, the default is 115200) as the Compiler's uP comm rate, 
then the Amulet controller will change to a generic &quot;Please wait while programming flash...&quot; screen and commence programming. If the page has a baud rate different than what the Compiler is set to, then you should 
set the <A HREF="compiler.htm#SerialSetup">uP comm rate</A> in the Settings-&gt;RS232 dialog 
box to match the baud rate set by the META tag. This will allow the HTMLCompiler 
to wake up the Amulet at one baud rate and then program it at&nbsp;another baud 
rate. The only time you should have to set Switch 1 to OFF (program mode) is 
when the project you compiled locks up the Amulet OS to the point where it won't 
accept the wake up message or if the Amulet OS has been corrupted and you need 
to <a href="compiler.htm#firmware_upgrade">reload the OS</a>.</p>
		<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
		<H2>Programming The Flash</H2>
<P>Click on the <B>Program Flash</B> button in the Compiler window. If there is a comm port conflict, the compiler will display &quot;Port is in use.&quot; If the compiler doesn't see the Amulet&nbsp;module, the compiler will display &quot;Serial port timed out.&quot; Normally, though, the compiler will display a series of messages as each file within the page is flashed. When the flash programming is complete, the compiler will display:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>&lt;Successfully Flashed...&gt;</B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="Images/flashedHome.gif" width="608" height="386" border="0"></P>
		<P><B>Congratulations!</B> You have successfully compiled and flashed your first Amulet uHTML page(s). The home page is now displayed on the LCD of the Amulet&nbsp;module. Navigate the GUI before proceeding to the next section.</P>
		<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
		<H2>Editing home.htm</H2>
<P>Now, it is time to personalize your GUI. Using a text editor, such as Notepad 
  or a &quot;WYSIWYG&quot; tool like Namo, open &quot;home.htm&quot; located in 
  the <A HREF="../projects/tour/" target="_blank">\projects\tour\</A> subdirectory 
  of the Amulet main directory. View the source code for the page and search for 
  &quot;Hello, World!&quot; between the &lt;BODY&gt; and &lt;/BODY&gt; tags. </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Images/helloWorld.gif" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="432" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
<P>Replace &quot;World&quot; with your name. For example, &quot;Hello, World&quot; should now read &quot;Hello, John!&quot;</P>
<P>Save the modified file and compile it.</P>
<P>Click on the Program Flash button.</P>
<P><B>Congratulations!</B> You have successfully modified an Amulet uHTML page. A personalized version of the home page is now displayed on the LCD of the Amulet module. If desired, see <A HREF="compiler.htm#Restore">Restoring
The Flash To Factory Configuration.<BR>

</A><HR ALIGN="CENTER">

<H2>Creating A GUI from Scratch</H2>
<P>Before you embark on creating your own GUI from scratch, a few tips are in 
  order:</P>
<ul>
  <li><B>Learn from our examples:</B> We have assembled a number of examples to 
    show you how to use HTML and Amulet Widgets. To find out more about the examples, 
    <a href="Examples.htm">Click&nbsp;Here</a>. You may also want to examine the 
    source code for the sample pages that were factory configured into your Amulet's Flash. The code resides in the <A HREF="../projects/EasyAs123/" target="_blank">\projects\EasyAs123</A> 
    subdirectory of the Amulet main directory. The home page is called home.html. 
    You can use any of these pages as templates for your own GUI. Just copy these 
    pages to your own subdirectory in \projects\ </li>
  <li><B>Minimum page requirements:</B> You MUST have at least one table on your 
    HTML page. The table dimensions attributes must specify the Height and Width 
    of the LCD (WIDTH=320, HEIGHT=240). All visible content must reside within 
    this table. You may add any number of rows and columns to this table. You 
    may also embed additional tables within any cell in this table. The width 
    and height must be specified for every table and the width must be specified 
    for every column in each table. Optionally, you can also specify the height 
    of each row.</li>
  <li><B>Start with a Template:</B> Finally, you should also be aware that there 
    is an empty project which contains only one page: template.html. This file 
    contains the MANDATORY 320x240 TABLE that is REQUIRED by the HTMLCompiler 
    for every single GUI page. You may add any number of rows and columns to this 
    table. You may also embed additional tables within any cell in this table. 
    Template.html is located in the <a href="../projects/empty/" target="_blank">\projects\empty</a> 
    subdirectory.</li>
</ul>
Have fun!

		<p><B>Boot Mode (Switch 1) -- </B>This switch is monitored during a reboot to determine the operational mode of the controller board; ON is the normal mode and OFF is the FLASH program mode. Upon clicking on the <B>Program Flash</B> button in the Compiler window, the Compiler will attempt to send out an auto &quot;wake-up&quot; message to the Amulet controller. If the page currently being displayed is set up to use the same baud rate using the <a href="HTMLSupport.htm#META">META</a> tag (if META is not present, the default is 115200) as the Compiler's uP comm rate, 
then the Amulet controller will change to a generic &quot;Please wait while programming flash...&quot; screen and commence programming. If the page has a baud rate different than what the Compiler is set to, then you should 
set the <A HREF="compiler.htm#SerialSetup">uP comm rate</A> in the Settings-&gt;RS232 dialog 
box to match the baud rate set by the META tag. This will allow the HTMLCompiler 
to wake up the Amulet at one baud rate and then program it at&nbsp;another baud 
rate. The only time you should have to set Switch 1 to OFF (program mode) is 
when the project you compiled locks up the Amulet OS to the point where it won't 
accept the wake up message or if the Amulet OS has been corrupted and you need 
to <a href="compiler.htm#firmware_upgrade">reload the OS</a>.</p>
		<p><B>Flash Mode Baud Rate (Switch 2) --</B> This switch sets the baud rate used during a Flash Reprogram. The ON position sets the hardware to 19,200 baud; OFF sets the hardware to 115,200 baud. This setting must match the baud rate selected in the Easy GUI HTMLCompiler software.</p>
		<p><B>RAM Test (Switch 3) -- </B>Turn this switch ON and then reboot the controller board to auto-execute a RAM test. A RAM test failure will result in a zero (0) volt signal on the MEM PASS test pad on the board; a pass will result in a 3.3 volt signal. </p>
		<p><B>Touchpanel Mode (Switch 4) --</B> This switch should remain ON during normal operation. Turn this switch OFF and then reboot the controller board to begin a touchpanel calibration. The controller will display a series of three calibration targets. Use a stylus to touch the center of each target. If necessary, the controller will repeat the calibration. When calibration is complete, the controller will return to normal operation. The switch must be returned to the normal mode (ON) before the next reboot to continue normal operation.<br>

		<p><B>NOTES:<br>
			</B></p>
		<ul>
<li>A copy of the &quot;Please wait while programming flash...&quot; page is stored in ..\Amulet\Projects\OS 
    Files\Flashing\Flashing.ahtml. It is setup specifically for 320 X 240 displays. If a different sized display is used, the size of the table in Flashing.ahtml should be changed to match the dimensions of the new display. Once the dimensions have been changed, open Flashing.ahtml in the HTMLCompiler and then program into the flash.<br>
