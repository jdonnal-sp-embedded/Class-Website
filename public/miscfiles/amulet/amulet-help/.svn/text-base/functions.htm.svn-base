<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Amulet Function Calls</h1>
<p> Amulet widgets use the <B>href</B> 
parameter to specify a function call.  See <a href="Widgets.htm">Widgets.htm</a> 
for a detailed description of widgets. A function call can be 
a hyperlink to another page, a request for the value of an external variable, 
a command to invoke a Remote Procedure Call and much more. A function call can 
also send a command to other widgets, known as <a href="IWC.htm">Inter-Widget Communication (IWC)</a>. 
 See <a href="AppendixB.htm">Appendix B</a> for a comprehensive 
list of all available functions. </p>
<p>The Easy GUI operating system uses 
  two general types of widgets: Control Widgets and View Widgets.</p>
<p>Control Widgets 
  are user input widgets such as list widgets, slider widgets, radio buttons, 
  checkboxes and function buttons. Anchors, META REFRESH objects and area maps can also 
call functions, like Control Widgets, but because they are not created using 
the &lt;APPLET&gt; tag, they are referred to as <a href="Objects.htm#ControlObjects">Control Objects</a>. 
Typically, Control Widget/Object function calls are initiated by a &quot;hit&quot; of the 
widget. A &quot;hit&quot; can occur one of two ways. </p>
<p>The typical way is the 
physical &quot;hit&quot;, which occurs when the active region of the object/widget 
on the touchscreen is touched  and then released while still within the 
bounds of the active region. The object/widget must 
be in focus when letting up on the touchscreen for the&nbsp;object/widget to 
initiate its function calls. If you touch an active region, but move off the 
region while still touching the touchscreen, the object/widget will lose 
focus, therefore, letting up on the touchscreen will do nothing.  </p>
<p>The alternative way a &quot;hit&quot; can occur is to have one Control Object/Widget 
invoke the forceHit() method of another Control Object/Widget. See <a href="IWC.htm">IWC 
documentation</a> for more information. </p>
<p>There are two exceptions to the rule that a &quot;hit&quot; initiates all 
function calls. The first exception is&nbsp;the Slider Widget. As soon as a 
pen down event occurs within the boundaries of a slider, a function call is 
initiated. If, while still in the pen down state, new values of the slider are&nbsp;selected, 
new function calls will be initiated. The second exception is&nbsp;Custom/Function 
Buttons which are set up to auto-repeat. If an auto-repeatable&nbsp;Custom/Function 
Button is touched, and stays in a pen down state&nbsp;longer than the time specified 
by the repeatDelay attribute, then a function call is initiated. As long as 
the button remains in a pen down state,&nbsp;the&nbsp;function calls will repeat 
at the frequency specified by the&nbsp;repeatRate attribute.</p>
<p>Control Objects/Widgets cannot call functions that 
return a value. See <A HREF="AppendixB.htm#Control_functions">Appendix B</A> for a comprehensive 
list of all valid control functions.</p>
<h3><a name="Multiple_Function "></a>Multiple Function Calls</h3>
<p>Control Objects/Widgets&nbsp;can call multiple functions at one time by  
  separating the functions by a comma. There is a limit of 36 multiple functions that can be attached to a single Control Widget/Object <B>href</B>. To 
illustrate how to use multiple functions, see the following example. To create 
a function button that invokes an external RPC 
#5 and then links to <B>page2.html</B>, use the following:</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>&lt;APPLET CODE=&quot;FunctionButton.class&quot; 
  WIDTH=&quot;150&quot; HEIGHT=&quot;25&quot; NAME=&quot;Button1&quot;&gt;<BR>
  &lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;href&quot; VALUE=&quot;Amulet:UART.invokeRPC(5), page2.html&quot;&gt;<BR>
  &lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;buttonType&quot; VALUE=&quot;spring-loaded&quot;&gt;<BR>
  &lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;label&quot; VALUE=&quot;test 5&quot;&gt;<BR>
  &lt;/APPLET&gt;</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Multiple function calls are performed 
in the order they are entered on the line, from <a href="#leftToRight">left to right</a><SUP>*</sup>. In the previous example, <B>Amulet:UART.invokeRPC(5) 
</B>would be called first, 
and then a hyperlink to <B>page2.html 
</B>would follow. As soon as a 
page is linked to, any subsequent function calls are discarded. For this reason, 
if it is desired to link to another page, that must be the last function call 
within a multiple function call. </p>
<p><b><sup><a name="leftToRight"></a>*</sup>Important notes regarding the order 
of multiple 
function calls:</B> If there is a mix of UART and InternalRAM or IWC function, 
the functions might not be performed from left to right. The reason for this 
is that UART functions are loaded into a UART transmit buffer whereas InternalRAM 
and IWC functions are loaded into a different function buffer. Due to the nature 
of UART transmissions, they will take a considerable amount of processor time 
to complete the function call in comparison to InternalRAM and IWC functions. 
Therefore, any InternalRAM or&nbsp;IWC function which is&nbsp;part of a multiple 
function call will most likely be finished prior to any UART function call which 
is part of the same multiple function call.</p>
<p>Another important point to note is that when functions are loaded into the 
function buffer, the value of the argument is loaded at that time. Most of the 
time, this is of no consequence. But, when you have a multiple function call 
that performs an action on an InternalRAM variable and then later within the 
multiple function call that same InternalRAM variable is used as an argument 
for another function, 
things might not happen in the order that you expect. The reason this is a problem 
is that the value of the InternalRAM used as the argument is loaded into the 
function buffer prior to the action taken on that InternalRAM variable.&nbsp;For example, let's 
say you  have 
a multiple function call that looks like this:</p>
<p><B>Amulet:InternalRAM.byte(0).inc(),Amulet:InternalRAM.byte(1).setValue(InternalRAM.byte(0))</B></p>
<p>Most likely, the person who created this multiple function call would expect 
InternalRAM.byte(0) to be incremented and the result of that increment will 
be 
saved into&nbsp;InternalRAM.byte(1). Unfortunately, this will not happen as 
expected. This is because both functions are loaded into the function buffer 
at the same time and the value of InternalRAM.byte(0) at that time is loaded 
as the argument for the second function. So, even though the increment takes 
place before InternalRAM.byte(1) has the setValue performed on it, the value 
used to store into InternalRAM.byte(1) is the value of InternalRAM.byte(0) prior 
to the increment. </p>
<p>Assuming you understand this explanation, the next obvious question is &quot;how 
do I work around this?&quot; The way to handle this is to use a separate META 
Refresh tag which will hold the second function call and the new multiple function 
call will perform a forceHit() on this META. This fixes the problem because 
the META Refresh's function isn't loaded into the function buffer until after 
the first function is actually performed. For example, the META Refresh would 
look like this:</p>
<p><B>&lt;META http-equiv=&quot;Refresh&quot; content=&quot;0;URL=Amulet:InternalRAM.byte(1).setValue(InternalRAM.byte(0));NAME=metaSet1&quot;&gt;</B></p>
<p>and the new multiple function call will look like this:</p>
<p><B>Amulet:InternalRAM.byte(0).inc(),Amulet:document.metaSet1.forceHit()</B>&nbsp;</p>
<hr width="70%" align="center"><h3><a name="Sequenced_Function"></a>Sequenced Function Calls</h3>
<p>Control Objects/Widgets can also call sequenced functions by separating the 
functions by semi-colons. Sequenced functions allow for different&nbsp;function 
calls at each successive &quot;hit&quot;. Sequenced function calls are performed 
in the order they are entered on the line, from left to right. The sequences 
continually wrap, so the first sequence&nbsp;follows the last sequence. To 
illustrate how to use sequenced functions, see the following example. To create 
a toggle type custom button that invokes an external RPC 
#5 when toggled&nbsp;down and invokes an external RPC #6 when toggled up, use the following:</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>&lt;APPLET CODE=&quot;CustomButton.class&quot; 
  WIDTH=&quot;150&quot; HEIGHT=&quot;25&quot; NAME=&quot;CustomBtn1&quot;&gt;<BR>
  &lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;href&quot; VALUE=&quot;Amulet:UART.invokeRPC(5);Amulet:UART.invokeRPC(6)&quot;&gt;<BR>
  &lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;buttonType&quot; VALUE=&quot;toggle&quot;&gt;<BR>
  &lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;upImage&quot; VALUE=&quot;myUpImage.gif&quot;&gt;<BR>
  &lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;downImage&quot; VALUE=&quot;myDownImage.gif&quot;&gt;<BR>
  &lt;/APPLET&gt;</B> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Sequenced function calls can also be made up of multiple function calls. There 
is a limit of 36 different sequences per Control Widget/Object <B>href </B>and 
each sequence can have a maximum of 36 multiple function calls<B>. </B>To help 
illustrate this, use the previous example, but instead of invoking RPC #5 for 
one sequence, and then RPC #6 for another sequence, let's assume we would like 
the first sequence to invoke RPC #4 and RPC #5, and the second sequence to invoke 
RPC #6 and RPC #7. To accomplish this, use: <B>Amulet:UART.invokeRPC(4),Amulet:UART.invokeRPC(5);Amulet:UART.invokeRPC(6),Amulet:UART.invokeRPC(7) </B>notice 
the sequences are separated by the semi-colon, and the multiple function calls 
are separated by the commas.</p>
<h3>View Widget Function Calls</h3>
<p>View Widgets are used for displaying data. 
  View Widgets include lineplots and bargraphs. View Widget function 
calls are initiated by either a timer event or the IWC method <B>forceUpdate</B>. The frequency of the timer event is specified 
by the <B>updateRate</B> 
parameter. They can only call a single function, 
and that function must return either a byte, word(2-bytes), or ASCII string. 
The returned value is used as the input to the View Widget.</p>
<h3><A NAME="FunctionConventions"></A>Function Call Conventions</h3>
<p>Amulet function calls borrow some of it syntax from 
Java Script, a scripting language used within HTML. Except for hyperlinks to 
other pages, all Amulet function calls start 
with &quot;<B>Amulet:</B>&quot;. 
The <B>Amulet:</B> 
signifies that what follows is an Amulet specific command. If it is desired to hyperlink to another HTML page, then just use the name 
of the file to link to in the <B>href</B> parameter.</p>
<p> Amulet function calls also borrow concepts from Java, an Object-Oriented 
Programming(OOP) language. When it is required to interface to an external server, 
use &quot;<B>Amulet:UART.</B>&quot; 
The  <B>UART. </B>can 
be thought of as a UART object. As in OOP, each 
object has its own set of data and a set of well-defined interfaces to that 
data. As in Java,  these interfaces are known as methods. Methods are just functions 
that are specific to a particular object. Each object has its own set of methods. 
</p>
<p>Examples: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;<B>Amulet:UART.byte(0).value()</B>&quot;<br><B>UART</B> specifies that a serial 
message will go out the UART.<br><B>byte(0)</B> specifies byte variable 0.<br><B>value()</B> 
specifies the value of byte variable 0 is returned.</p>
<p><B>&quot;Amulet:internalRAM.word(5).setValue(0xF020)&quot;<br>internalRAM</B> 
specifies the dual port RAM onboard the Amulet.<br><B>word(5)</B> specifies the internal 
RAM word variable 5.<br><B>setValue(0xF020)</B> specifies internal RAM word variable 
5 is to be set to the value 0xF020.</p>
<p><B>'Amulet:internalRAM.string(5).setValue(&quot;Your String&quot;)'<br>internalRAM</B> 
specifies the dual port RAM onboard the Amulet.<br><B>string(5)</B> specifies the internal 
RAM string variable 5.<br><B>setValue(&quot;Your String&quot;)</B> specifies 
that internal RAM string variable 
5 is to contain the null terminated string&nbsp;&quot;Your String&quot;. Note 
that the string variable is enclosed within double quotes while the entire function 
is enclosed within single quotes. For more information regarding string variables, 
see the note <a href="Widgets.htm#stringVariables">regarding string variables.</a></p>
<p>The same nomenclature as Java 
is used, where a method is called by using the object's name followed 
by the dot operator, followed by the method. Amulet has added a new wrinkle 
with  the concept of multiple byte, word and string variables. Since there can 
be 256 different byte variables, 256 different word variables and 201 different 
19-character string variables, there needs to be a way of&nbsp;specifing the 
type of variable as well as the variable number. Therefore, if the object is 
a byte, word, or string variable, the nomenclature is of the following type: 
<br><B>Amulet:<i>object</i>.<i>variable</i>(variable #).<i>method</i>(argument, 
if needed).</B> <br><B>Amulet:</B> specifies an Amulet specific command. <br><B><i>object</i></B> 
can be UART or InternalRAM. variable.<br><B><i>variable</i> </B>can be byte, 
word or string.<br><B>variable #</B> can be a number from 0-255 for byte and 
word variables, and 0-200 for string variables.<br><B><i>method</i></B> can 
be any number of methods described in Appendix B.</p>
<p>See example below, where a function 
button, when pressed, causes a Remote Procedure Call # 5 to be sent out the 
UART to the external server:</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>&lt;APPLET CODE=&quot;FunctionButton.class&quot; 
  WIDTH=&quot;150&quot; HEIGHT=&quot;25&quot; NAME=&quot;Button1&quot;&gt;<BR>
  &lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;href&quot; VALUE=&quot;Amulet:UART.invokeRPC(5)&quot;&gt;<BR>
  &lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;label&quot; VALUE=&quot;test 5&quot;&gt;<BR>
  &lt;/APPLET&gt;</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The <B>href</B> line  invokes the <B>invokeRPC()</B> 
method on <B>UART</B>. 
That is, it calls <B>invokeRPC()</B> 
relative to the UART 
object. Thus, the call 
to <B>UART.invokeRPC()</B> 
causes the UART in the Amulet controller to send out an &quot;invokeRPC&quot; 
command.</p>
<p>The method <B>invokeRPC()</B> requires 
an argument (a parameter that is passed to the method that the method uses as 
its input).  As a rule of thumb, the argument passed to any method is the intrinsic 
value of the calling widget/object. Only Control Widgets/Objects have an intrinsic 
value. Function buttons can specify an intrinsic value by using <B>&lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;buttonValue&quot; VALUE=&quot;5&quot;&gt;</B><font size="2"><b> 
</b></FONT>or by including a number 
between the ()'s. Widgets that can have multiple intrinsic values, like lists 
and sliders, must not include a number between the ()'s, since their intrinsic 
value is dependent upon the state of the widget. </p>
